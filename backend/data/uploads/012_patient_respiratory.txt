---------- ASSESSMENT & PLAN ----------
1. Persistent cough likely secondary to: post-viral, possible asthma component, GERD
2. Asthma - well controlled on current inhaler therapy
3. Environmental allergies - positive allergy testing
4. Prescribed:
   - Trial of H2-blocker (Famotidine) for GERD optimization
   - High-dose Vitamin D 2000 IU daily
   - Consider allergy immunotherapy referral
5. Monitor for duration of cough; if persists >4 weeks, consider CT scanning

---------- DOCTOR'S NOTES ----------
Patient is frustrated with persistent cough interfering with work. No fever, no dyspnea at rest. Oxygen saturation excellent. Lung sounds mostly clear with minimal wheezing. Likely multi-factorial etiology. Patient counseled on environmental triggers and instructed on proper inhaler technique. Strong recommendation to continue allergen avoidance measures.
